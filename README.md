This is a RESTful API developed using ASP.NET Core Web API to manage a collection of books. The API allows users to perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on book records. It supports retrieving all books, fetching a specific book by ID, adding new books, updating existing ones, and deleting them. The project follows clean architecture principles and is structured for scalability and maintainability.
 The API is secured to some extent and is designed to return JSON responses in a standard format. It can be easily tested using Swagger UI or Postman.
